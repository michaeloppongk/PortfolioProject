Welcome to my portfolio showcasing various projects I've undertaken as a data analyst and scientist! This collection highlights my SQL skills through diverse datasets, including Nashville Housing Data, COVID-19 trends, film industry insights, and flight analysis. Each project demonstrates my ability to manipulate, query, and analyze data to derive meaningful insights and support informed decision-making.

In the **Nashville Housing Data** project, I utilized advanced SQL techniques to explore housing trends, perform aggregations, and visualize key metrics. The **COVID-19 project** involved analyzing global health data from the WHO, revealing patterns and trends that informed public health strategies. My work in the **film industry** showcased my expertise in customer behavior analysis, examining payment patterns and customer demographics to optimize revenue. Finally, the **flight analysis** project leveraged complex joins and subqueries to assess passenger seating preferences and pricing strategies, aiming to enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency. Together, these projects illustrate my comprehensive SQL capabilities and my commitment to delivering data-driven insights across various domains.
